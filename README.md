# APT-Screening-Minecraft-Server

This project includes a Minecraft Server with a battery of minigames for the screening of Auditory Processing Disorder with preadolescents.

The minigame battery is only available in Spanish and includes three different performance tests:

- Temporal differentations between tones (Developed)
- Speech-in-noise understanding (Developed)
- Discrimination between similar word (Under development)

The Minigame Server is configured to run in Minecraft's 1.17.1 version. We strongly encourage to download Fabric's modded version of Minecraft 1.17.1 to leverage SimpleVoiceChat's modpack.

## Installation

Clone the github repository at your desired location. You can use the run.bat file in the root directory to directly launch the server. Before doing so, remember changing the path of the java instalation. Java 17 is required.
