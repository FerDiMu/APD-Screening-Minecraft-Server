# This is a set of commands that will be executed when a player joins the spigot server.

    # Valid Placeholders:
    # - {player} - The name of the player that joined
    #
    # Valid Prefixes:
    # - no prefix - Execute the command as the serverconsole (e.g. "eco give {player} 100")
    # - [PLAYER] - Execute the command as a player (e.g. "[PLAYER]kit tools")
    # - [OP] - Execute the command as the player, but with OP permissions (e.g. "[OP]warp opsOnlyArea")
    # - [BPLAYER] - Execute the command as the player, but through the BungeeCord Proxy
    # - [BCONSOLE] - Execute the command as the BungeeCord Proxy console
    #
    # Using [BPLAYER] or [BCONSOLE] require you to setup the 'bungeecord-hook' option properly.
